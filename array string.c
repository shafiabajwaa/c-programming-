The program should perform the following tasks:

Create a function to input data of N employees (N ≤ 10).
Store:

employee names in a character array

employee information in a 2D integer array, where each row contains:

employee ID

employee grade

number of working days

Create a function that calculates the monthly salary of each employee based on grade:

Grade 1 → Rs. 30,000

Grade 2 → Rs. 50,000

Grade 3 → Rs. 80,000

Salary should be proportional to working days, assuming total working days = 30.
